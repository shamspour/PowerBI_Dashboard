# Super Bowl Ads Dashboard (Power BI)
![Overview](Images/overview.gif)
## Introduction
This dashboard is designed for **marketing analysts, advertisers, and media strategists** who need a unified view of **Super Bowl commercial performance** across brands and years.  
The core problem it solves is that **costs, TV reach, YouTube engagement, and creative style (funny vs serious)** are usually scattered across sources‚Äîmaking it hard to compare effectiveness or spot trends quickly.  
With this report, stakeholders can answer questions like:
- Which **brands** invested the most, and how did their ads perform?
- How did **ad volumes and costs** evolve over time (2000‚Äì2022)?
- Do **funny ads** outperform **serious ads** on YouTube views and likes?
- What‚Äôs the balance between **traditional TV views** and **online engagement**?

The dataset used in this analysis comes from a **Super Bowl ads dataset** (inspired by the YouTube tutorial [Power BI Super Bowl Ads Dashboard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIhVG4OqMk8&list=PLwIcJx1aSL1SeTJgPbFgf1V-5CfsV4l1l&index=5)), containing details such as **brand**, **year**, **ad style** (funny/serious), **TV views**, **YouTube views & likes**, and **estimated ad costs**.
